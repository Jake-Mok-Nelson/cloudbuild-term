# cloudbuild-term
Review Google Cloudbuilds in the terminal

## Why?

Who wants to use a GUI to track down cloudbuilds when there could be many that are running concurrently across multiple projects?

## Planned Features

- View cloudbuilds across one or many projects at once
- Deep dive into builds or view at a high level
- Use plugins to validate output, e.g. a Terraform plugin could simplify the build output or give a blast radius score?
