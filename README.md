# cloudbuild-term
Review Google Cloudbuilds in the terminal

## Why?

Who wants to use a GUI to track down cloudbuilds when there could be many that are running concurrently across multiple projects?

## Use Cases

- Monitoring software builds including the results of each stage, dive into a stage for more information.
- Monitoring infrastructure plans (terraform) through the use of plugins?
